# Trail of Cthulhu 2nd Edition Quickstart for Foundry VTT

This is a module for [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) that adds a Quickstart system for the [Trail of Cthulhu 2nd Edition](https://pelgranepress.com/trail-of-cthulhu-second-edition/) campaign setting.

*You will also need the [INVESTIGATOR System](https://github.com/n3dst4/gumshoe-fvtt) to use this module - Foundry will prompt you to install it if you don't have it already.*

Includes:

* An introduction to the Trail of Cthulhu 2nd Edition game.
* A starter adventure, "Stranger Shores".
* Six pre-generated characters, each with their own abilities, motivations, and backstories.
* A new character sheet theme to match the art style of the Trail of Cthulhu 2nd Edition book.
