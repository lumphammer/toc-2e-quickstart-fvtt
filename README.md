# Trail of Cthulhu 2nd Edition Quickstart for Foundry VTT

This is the official Trail of Cthulhu 2nd Edition quickstart module for Foundry VTT.

This module gives you a fully playable QuickStart version of [Trail of Cthulhu 2nd Edition](https://pelgranepress.com/trail-of-cthulhu-second-edition/).


## Includes

* An introduction to the Trail of Cthulhu 2nd Edition game.
* A starter adventure, "Stranger Shores".
* Seven pre-generated characters, each with their own abilities, motivations, and backstories.
* A new character sheet theme to match the art style of Trail of Cthulhu 2nd Edition.
* A thematic map of Brenton Point, Rhode Island, where the adventure is set.


## How to install

You will need a [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) server - see [the Foundry VTT Installation Guide](https://foundryvtt.com/article/installation/) for details.

Install the the [GUMSHOE System](https://github.com/n3dst4/gumshoe-fvtt). You can by clicking "Game Systems" and searching for "GUMSHOE" in the "Install System" dialog.

Install this module by clicking "Add-on Modules" and searching for "Trail of Cthulhu 2e Quickstart" in the "Install Module" dialog.


## How to use

Create a new world or load your an existing GUMSHOE system world (remember to take a backup if you're using an existing world!).

Activate the module in the "Manage modules" dialog (find it in the sidebar). Allow the page to reload.

You will be prompted to import the Quickstart content, including the Quickstart text, the "Stranger Shorts" scenario, and the pre-generated characters.

After the adventure has been imported, you'll be prompted to apply the Trail of Cthulhu 2e preset - this will apply all the settings needed to make the world run with ToC 2e rules.

Once you've done that, you can start playing the game!
